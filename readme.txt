Tuo, S.; Zhang, J.; Yuan, X.; He, Z.; Liu, Y.; Liu, Z. Niche harmony search algorithm for detecting complex disease associated high-order SNP combinations. Sci. Rep. 2017, 7, 11529. 

Genome-wide association study is especially challenging in detecting high-order disease-causing
models due to model diversity, possible low or even no marginal effect of the model, and extraordinary
search and computations. In this paper, we propose a niche harmony search algorithm where joint
entropy is utilized as a heuristic factor to guide the search for low or no marginal effect model, and two
computationally lightweight scores are selected to evaluate and adapt to diverse of disease models.
In order to obtain all possible suspected pathogenic models, niche technique merges with HS, which
serves as a taboo region to avoid HS trapping into local search. From the resultant set of candidate
SNP-combinations, we use G-test statistic for testing true positives. Experiments were performed on
twenty typical simulation datasets in which 12 models are with marginal effect and eight ones are with
no marginal effect. Our results indicate that the proposed algorithm has very high detection power
for searching suspected disease models in the first stage and it is superior to some typical existing
approaches in both detection power and CPU runtime for all these datasets. Application to age-related
macular degeneration (AMD) demonstrates our method is promising in detecting high-order diseasecausing
models.
